## What is Ubikron?

Ubikron is a Chrome Extension that add dozens of new features to your browser to make your intelligence work more efficient. It can automatically save page text and screenshots, extract key data (emails, phone numbers, usernames) and search for them in dozens of #osint tools. Analyse information and write reports using AI prompts. Actually, it has many other features.

## What is "data type" and entity extraction?

<img src="extractions.png" width="100%" />

After Ubikron saves the text and screenshot of the page into a project, it extracts well known entities (emails, phone numbers, nicknames, ISBN etc) from it using regular expressions. This is called entity extraction.

Default extractions are: GPS coordinates, name, IPV6, email address, phone number, url, alias, crypto address, hashtag, website, domain, hash, ip address and cidr.

To see what extra extractions you have and to set up new ones, go to the menu Settings -> Entity extractions.


## What is entity enrichment?

<img src="enrichment_example.png" width="100%" />

If you right-click on a string of extracted data (such as a phone number), a contextual menu opens with quick links to collect information about it. For example, search for social media profiles with Epieos and check against the ScamSearch database.

By default, there are only a few universal enrichments for each data type, but you can remove the unnecessary ones and install additional ones that best suit the goals of your investigation.


## How do we add enrichment in Ubikron?

<img src="enrichments_creation.png" width="100%" />

Go to Settings -> Entity Enrichments.

Click "Add new action" button.

<img src="new_action.png" width="100%" />

Specify the name of the data enrichments (any name you feel comfortable with)

Optionally, set the priority (where the enrichment will be displayed in the context menu).

Select one or more data types for which this enrichments will be active. If a data type is missing from the list, open Entity extraction and add it there (just copy the regular expression from this repository or another source).

Specify the URL for enrichment. This should be a site that can be manipulated to download data using URL parameters (GET requests). Replace the parameter value with {value}. You can see many examples of such sites below in this repository.

Click "Save".

Press F5 to finally add enrichment to the context menu.

## Can we add many enrichments at once?

<img src="import_export.png" width="100%" />

You can export your enrichments list as a TXT file to import into your other projects or share with other users.

Use the buttons in the bottom right corner to do this.

To import all the enrichments mentioned in this list you can import one file: all_advanced_enrichments.txt (we can't link it here, else GitHub kicks the repo)


## Value functions

Sometimes the format of the extracted data does not match the format used by a particular search tool. A simple example: ISBN (International Standard Book Number) is extracted with dashes, but Amazon Books uses the number without dashes as the URL parameter. This problem is solved by using the stripPunct function:

https://www.amazon.com/s?i=stripbooks&rh=p_66%3A{value:stripPunct}

Also, sometimes it is only necessary to find information on a portion of the extracted data. For example, username from an email address or last name from a full name:

https://www.truthfinder.com/results/?firstName={value:firstName}&lastName={value:lastName}

Just add :functionName to value. Here's a list of functions that can be added now:

| Function name | Description | Input value | Output value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| firstName | Get first name from full name (first word from two) | Porting Notfound | Porting |
| lastName | Get first name from full name (second word from two) | Porting Notfound| Notfound|
| domainFromEmail | Get domain name from email address | kosie123.kramer@kramer.com | kramer.com |
| stripPunct | Remove anything that is not A-Z or a-z or 0-9 | 978-2-13-060852-3 | 9782130608523 |
| spaceToNothing | Delete spaces from string | Porting Notfound | PortingNotfound|
| stripPhone | Replace all no digits symbols to dashes | +1 086 123 1234 | -1-086-123-1234 |
| spaceToDash | Replace all spaces to dashes | +1 086 123 1234  | +1-086-123-1234 |
| spaceToSlash | Replace all spaces to slashes  | +1 086 123 1234 | +1/086/123/1234 |
| firstIP | Remove symbols after / from IP string | 192.1.56.10/96| 192.1.56.10 |
| noEndcoding | By default, all values are handled by the encodeURI() standard JavaScript function. This function cancels encoding. | https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FCristiano | https://www.facebook.com/Cristiano|
| userFromEmail | Get username from email address  | kosie@kramer.com| kosie |
| splitByCommaAndTrim | Split string by comma and remove spaces | abc , def | abc |

## Advanced extractions

Ubikron has the ability to add an unlimited number of extractions using regular expressions (PCRE). But keep in mind that too many regular expressions can slow down data extraction from web pages. Therefore, we recommend disabling those that don't fit the purpose of your current investigation.

Here is a list of extractions that are not added to Ubikron by default, but are used in enrichments from the list below.

| Extraction name | Description | Regex | Match example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| vin | Venicle Identification Number | \b([A-HJ-NPR-Z0-9]{17})\b | 6ZZ0000PV35400637 |
| bank-card-number | Bank Card Number | \b(?:\d[ -]?){16}\b | 4166 6766 6766 6746 |
| shipping container  | Shipping Container Number | \b([A-Z]{3}[UJZ])\d{6}\d\b | MSCU5285725 |
| flight-number  | Flight Number  | \b([A-Z]{2,3}\d{1,4}[A-Z]?)\b | AA6881 |
| doi | Digital Object Identifier | 10.\d{4,9}/[-._;()/:A-Z0-9]+ | 10.1007/BF00137611  |
| cin | Corporate Identification Number | \b[LUlu][0-9]{5}[A-Za-z]{2}[0-9]{4}[A-Za-z]{3}[0-9]{6}\b | U45203WB1995PTC074213  |


PS: All of the extractions can be imported from this file:  [all_advanced_extractions.txt](https://github.com/ubikron/Advanced-Enrichment/Advanced-Enrichment/all_advanced_extractions.txt).

## I developed an online tool. Can I make Ubikron users use it with enrichments?

If you've made some sort of information gathering tool, it's legal and it can be run via a link with a URL parameter, we'd probably be happy to add it to this one on the list. Write about it in the issues to this repository.


## Emoji in enrichments descriptions


In this list, we tried to focus on tools that provide at least some of the information for free and without registration. We also try to mention tools that do not violate the law. But there are some exceptions, which are marked with appropriate emoji:


ðŸ”‘ - login required  

ðŸ’° - paid subscrition required
